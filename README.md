# HomeLab
A repo with my HomeLab config.

For anyone who cares how it works:
1. Hyper-V Server 2019 is currently the hypervisor being used. The user should install this on their machine.
2. Once installed, the user can use the provided Packer configs to build their inages.
3. PowerForm is used to build VMs from images.
